# Design Patterns

## Task
To use design patterns in real life situations. 

The topic used is Housing Complexes. The process of building a big housing complex with many apartaments, parking lots, different budgets and people involved.

## Implementation
The project is written in Python 3.8.5

### Creational Design Patterns

Patterns used in the repository:

* Abstract Factory
* Factory method
* Builder
* Prototype

##### Abstract Factory

An abstract factory is used here in order to obtain a factory based on the budget allocated for the building. 

##### Factory method

Factories are used to create apartaments, parking lots, children playgrounds grouped by budget.

##### Builder

Builder is used for creating Housing Complex. We can set number of floors, entrances, number of paking lots, whether the lot is closed or has 
surveilance. Also, we can specify the number of rooms and balconies for apartaments. 

##### Prorotype
Prototype is used for copying the base apartament returned by a factory and changing it as needed.
