# Behaviour Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Task
To use structural design patterns in real life situations. 

The topic used is Housing Complexes. The process of adding residents and administrators to a block of apartaments and notifing all the current actors.
a big housing complex with many apartaments, parking lots, playgrounds etc.

## Implementation
The project is written in Python 3.8.6

Patterns used in the repository:

* Observer


### Observer
Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects 
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

The Observer is used in the project in order to notify all the residents and administrators of an apartament block about updates that happen.


```
    def notify(self, event):
        print("Subject: Notifying observers...\n")
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(event)
```
In order to receive or stop receiving notifications use attach and detach functions:

```
    def attach(self, observer: Observer):
        print("Subject: Attached a new resident.")
        self._observers.append(observer)


    def detach(self, observer: Observer):
        self._observers.remove(observer)
```


The pattern is used in a small client app:
```
    aparatments_block = AparatmentsBlock()

    while True:
        print("Introduce 1 for moving in to the building")
        print("Introduce 2 to register as administrator")


        val = int(input())
        family = input("Your family name: ")

        if val == 1:
            resident = Resident(family)
            aparatments_block.new_resident(resident)
            if_subscribe(aparatments_block, resident)
        elif val == 2:
            manager = ApartamentsManager(family)
            aparatments_block.new_manager(manager)
            aparatments_block.attach(manager)

```
The result:
